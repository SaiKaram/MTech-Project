Unmanned robots and vehicles capture videos using a head mounted cameras. It is not possible for them to capture a steady video without any shakes. These videos are mainly used for path planning, so that a robot avoids stumbling on the nearby objects. For accurate path planning, a robot needs more information, i.e., a larger view of the surroundings. Since a camera comes with limited field of view, we have to stitch the captured videos to get a larger view of the surroundings. But stitching poses serious problem due to inherent shakiness of the videos. So, we need a joint video stabilization and stitching framework.
In this project, I have developed a near real-time joint video stitching algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed method was verified on publicly
available videos.
